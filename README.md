# Pokemon Team Builder Plus! 
<!-- Pokemon Team Builder uses PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/)
to render pokemon sprites, allows user to click sprites and have the Pokemon info load in the center. It will show the pokemon name, official artwork, types, and pokemon descriptions. There is a button the generate new description text. A second button allows the user to add pokemon to their team and that pokemon appears on the right side under the "My Team" label. The user can also search by name or pokedex number. Buttons at the top of the page allow them to browse. The first and last page are conveyed by having the back and forward button disabled respectively. There is a six pokemon limit and if the user tries to add more, a error message appears notifying them of the limit. There is a button to set them free if the user would like to add a different Pokemon instead. Errors also appear if the user tries to search for a name or number that doesn't exist. -->
Everyone has heard of Pokemon. The franchise has fans worldwide, whether it be for the games, the anime, or just that they're cute! One thing I love in Pokemon, and in most games, is the lore. The time the creators take to make the story behind the gameplay brings the world to life so much more. I wanted a way to browse the fascinating stories behind the monsters while also incorporating a main feature from the games. That feature was team building. So I decided to build Pokemon Team Builder Plus!
