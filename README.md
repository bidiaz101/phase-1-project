# Pokemon Team Builder Plus! 

Everyone has heard of Pokemon. The franchise has fans worldwide, whether it be for the games, the anime, or just that they're cute! One thing I love in Pokemon, and in most games, is the lore. The time the creators take to make the story behind the gameplay brings the world to life so much more. I wanted a way to browse the fascinating stories behind the monsters while also incorporating a main feature from the games. That feature was team building. So I decided to build Pokemon Team Builder Plus! (Or "Team Builder" for short)

### Browse Pokemon

Users can browse Pokemon using the buttons and the search field. They can either search by name, or by pokedex number. Once they select a Pokemon, that Pokemon will appear in the center as shown in the next section below.

### View Pokemon

This is how the Pokemon will appear once the user chooses one. It shows the name, an image of the pokemon, and the type/types.

They then have the option of generating more Pokedex entries and learning more about the pokemon and it's abilities by pressing the "Get More Info" button.

Two different entries are shown below.

### Team Building 

The user will also have the option of adding the Pokemon to their team. Below the "Get More Info" button is an "Add to Team" button. This will bring the user to the top of the page, add the Pokemon's sprite to the area labeled "My Team", and temporarily highlight the added Pokemon.

In the games, you can have a maximum of six team members and the same is true here. The user will see the error message shown below if they try to add more than six pokemon.

They can add more once they click the "Set Free" button below one of their current team members. This will cause the Pokemon on their team to disappear and the user can add another in it's place.
